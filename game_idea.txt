Shared public hub for crafting, trading, socializing

each Area outside of the shared public hub is either solo or party instanced

each area will have a room table and encounter table, you roll a random room, and a random encounter.
some rooms can have multiple encounters in one room

example:

Dungeon - Spider queen nest

ROOMS
START. Dark Corridor
1. Prison Cells
2. Torturing Chambers
3. Stairscase upwards
4. Staircase downwards
5. Barren Barracks
END. The "Nest"

ENCOUNTERS
START. Giant web with a human, this is a "safe room" you can rest here
1. 1d4 spiderlings
2. chest filled with loot
3. chest that is a mimic
4. 1d4 huge spiders
5. 1d4 spiderlings and 1d4 huge spiders
END. Spider queen

Lets instance the dungeon and see what rooms we get, if the creator rolls 6, 
that is the end and essentially the final room

Torturing chambers, id4 huge spiders
Staircase upwards, chest with loot
The "Nest"

this time we got a short dungeon
