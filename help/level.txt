Title: Level
Syntax: "level <stat>" 

You use the level command to level up when you have accumulated enough exp.
Exp is a stat that does not decrease, but you need more exp per level to use the level command

When you level up, you need to state which stat to add one score into.
After you have leveled up, you get one "practice point" to spend.

The "points" are used to practice a skill, with the "practice" command
