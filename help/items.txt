Title: Items and item types

Items are objects you can pick up and interact with
Just "item" items are misc items, they dont do anything 

Items that are "equipment" can be equiped and provide stats

Items that are "consumable" can be used on yourself freely, whenever you want to use them
In a fight, you need to wait for your turn to use an item.

consumable items can also be used on others aswell, but only in combat.
if you want someone to use a potion of healing outside of combat, you need to give them the potion.
