Title: Death, resting and ressurecting

The "rest" command is very useful, when you "rest" you:
- Regenerate all HP and MP
- Ressurect if you are dead
- Recall back to your resting spot (fast way to travel home)

Use "rest set" to set your resting spot.
Use "rest now" to go and rest.

Rest cannot be used while in combat.
