      Rat hunter Edward has asked me to kill some rats for them
      I wonder if I get to become a rat hunter when im finished!
    completed: |
      That was a workout! But now I've killed enough rats to 
      prove that im worthy of the rat hunter title!
    turned_in: |

      They were very happy!
